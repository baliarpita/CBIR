 CBIR is developed to act as an image search engine on a trained dataset of images.
 It is based on digital image processing branch of computer science.
 CBIR stands for "Content based image retrieval".
 Technologies used: OpenCV, Python.
 
 Given an image, the application will return similar images from a trained dataset of images. The image serach is built entirely on the image descriptor: color. It does not use any metadata related to the image to perform search. Images are displayed in descending order of similarity from most similar image to least similar image.
 
 The image database is located here: CBIR/src/dataset/
