 Contennt Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is is an image search engine trained on a dataset of images.
 It is built using digital image processing and machine learning branch of computer science.
 
 Technologies used: OpenCV, Python.
 
Value Proposition: Given an image, the application will return similar images from a trained dataset of images. The image serach is built entirely on the image descriptor: color. It does not use any metadata related to the image to perform search. Images are displayed in descending order of similarity from most similar image to least similar image with the algorithm usign histogram as a means to scan and process images for ranking.
 
 The image database is located here: CBIR/src/dataset/
